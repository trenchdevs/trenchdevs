    <div class="mt-4 p-2">

        <p>
            My name is Donmari, and I’m a first-time and stay-at-home mom. I’m happily married to my longtime high
            school
            crush, Chris.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have a 10 month old son, Christopher, but we call him by his nickname, Bokchoy. Interestingly enough,
            ‘Growing Bokchoy’ fits perfectly for the blog name as we will see him grow throughout my blog posts.

            Before I gave birth, no matter how much I read or researched about motherhood and parenting, I had to learn
            the
            hard way of knowing that every child is different and nothing is consistent. I also learned that some of my
            experiences could be the same as someone else’s. And that is why I wanted to share my experience and
            struggle as
            a mom.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want my blog to be a safe space for other moms. We have different battles we’re taking, so please bear
            with me
            as I go with you on this journey.
